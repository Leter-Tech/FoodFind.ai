## üéØ Problem Statement

Every day, tons of food are wasted while millions go hungry. People forage for food without knowing if it‚Äôs safe to eat. Donors willing to share surplus food face complicated sign-ups. Volunteers eager to help get stuck in confusing delivery processes. And those in need struggle to find nearby food banks.  

**FoodFind.ai** was created to change this. It bridges these gaps‚Äîconnecting donors, recipients, and volunteers through a single, seamless platform powered by AI. Our mission: **Less waste, more plates.**

## üí° Solution

**FoodFind.ai** offers a comprehensive, user-friendly solution for food donation and delivery:

### **1. Foraged Food Screen:**  
Wondering if foraged food is safe to eat? Just snap a photo. Our AI, powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, analyzes the image and provides:  
- **Nutritional Profile:** Carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals.  
- **Safety Analysis:** Detects toxicity, estimates shelf life, and checks quality.  
- **Additional Notes:** Offers preparation methods, storage tips, and allergen warnings.  
This feature is invaluable for people in need‚Äîhelping them identify safe, nutritious food instantly.  

### **2. Donate Food Screen:**  
Want to share surplus food? It‚Äôs easy‚Äîno login required. Donors, including households and restaurants, can quickly post details such as:  
- **Name, Contact, Location:** For direct outreach.  
- **Food Image and Serving Size:** Helping recipients understand what‚Äôs available.  
- **Expiry Date and Status Updates:** Mark posts as ‚ÄúAccepting,‚Äù ‚ÄúUnder Collection,‚Äù or ‚ÄúNon-Veg.‚Äù  
- **Passcode Protection:** Donors can edit or delete posts later using a unique passcode.  
This no-login, passcode-based system makes donating fast, secure, and user-friendly.  

### **3. Find Food Screen:**  
Need food? Find it instantly. The Find Food screen shows real-time posts from donors, including images, locations, and contact information. Plus:  
- **AI Nutrition Analysis:** Tap the ‚ÄúNutrition AI‚Äù button to instantly analyze the food image, providing nutritional value, freshness, and safety notes.  
- **Contact Donors:** Call or message donors directly from the app.  
- **Request Delivery:** Tap ‚ÄúRequest Delivery‚Äù to get help from volunteers.  
- **Open in Google Maps:** Get directions to the food pickup location instantly.  

### **4. Volunteer Delivery Screen:**  
Want to help? Deliver food to those in need. The Volunteer Delivery screen lists delivery requests from recipients. Here‚Äôs how it works:  
- **Accept Nearby Deliveries:** View donor and recipient details with pickup and drop-off locations.  
- **No Duplicate Claims:** Once a volunteer accepts a request, it disappears for others.  
- **OTP-Based Security:**  
  - Recipients can **dismiss unreliable volunteers** using their OTP, reopening the request for others.  
  - Once delivered, recipients confirm completion using the OTP, closing the request. This OTP-based delivery system ensures secure, efficient deliveries without logins.  

### **5. Food Banks Finder Screen:**  
Looking for a food bank? Find it with a tap. The Food Banks Finder uses Google Maps to show nearby food banks based on your location or entered address. It‚Äôs fast, simple, and potentially life-saving.  

### **6. No-Login Architecture:**  
Forget passwords‚Äîhelp faster. Our passcode and OTP-based system means:  
- **Donors:** Post, edit, or delete listings using their passcode‚Äîno account needed.  
- **Volunteers:** Accept and complete deliveries with secure OTP verification.  
- **Recipients:** Request deliveries and track status without signing up.  
This secure, no-login system ensures that anyone can contribute or receive help without barriers.  

### **7. Cross-Platform Compatibility (iOS and Android):**  
One app for everyone. Built with React Native, FoodFind.ai runs smoothly on both iOS and Android. Whether you‚Äôre a donor on iPhone or a recipient on Android, everyone stays connected. With Expo‚Äôs support, the app updates instantly across both platforms‚Äîbecause hunger knows no platform.
